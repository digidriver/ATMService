# ATMService
An ATM test service that allows clients to deposit and withdraw funds (and check their balance too). This is a test service which can be run in a totally-enclosed internal environment (no security add-ons have been implemented, this is a pure "proof-of-concept" build).

When this readme was initially built, only the core service code was uploaded. Other sections/plugins can be added (such as a separate client website or console application for client access).
